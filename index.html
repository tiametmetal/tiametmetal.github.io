            <h2>About Me</h2>
			<h3>Jake Vandrake</h3>
            <p>Born in the mid 80s, rock music was always playing on the radio in my house. My early days were spent listening to local radio that played the rock hits of the time. Ozzy, Metallica, Guns and Roses, Tom Petty,
				Bob Segar, ACDC, and many more played continuously on my fathers favorate station. As I grew up throughout the mid to late 90s, I had a few different types of friends and listened to a few different types of
				of music. However, in my early teen years, with the explosion that was Nu Metal, I was sucked in by the angst filled rebellious nature of the music. Bands like NIN, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, and Marilyn Manson ignited
				my interest into agressive music. Later bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot, Mudvayne, System of a Down, Rammstein, White Zombie, and Rob Zombie reinforced my love for the genre. International bands such as Soilwork, In Flames,
				Cradle of Filth, and Children of Bodem opened my eyes to music outside of the states. From then on out I have explored many different types of rock and metal genres, rediscovering old favorites and finding brand new
				favorites along the way. This Blogs purpose is to show my journey through the music that I love and continue to discover new bands and albums that I can share with you.

                <h2>A Modern Classic</h2>
                <p>I came across <b>Countless Skies</b> on bandcamp. I do believe that this album popped up as a recommendation due to my prior purchases of other Melodic Death albums. As I listen to this album, I can make many comparisons to
				Devin Townsend and his brand of music. Layered song structures, soaring vocals and choruses, deep impactful growls in all the right places, and beautifully crafted melodies through out. <u>Glow</u> is a delight to listen too
				and stays in my album rotation to this day. Currently only one of two albums that I own two copies of in my physical collection, this says alot about how much I adore <u>Glow</u> by <b>Countless Skies</b>.</p>
